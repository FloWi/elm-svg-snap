# elm-svg-snap

A playground to handle drag-and-drop in svg's with elm.

inspired by [@avh4's](https://twitter.com/avh4) great tutorial on re-creating the elm-logo with svg.
Here's his [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMxwECIC7mc).

In his tutorial, Aaron placed the tiles programatically by making and point on one shape "snap" to the point on another shape. 
I'll try to figure out, if I can make the polygons "magnetic". Perhaps you've seen it in apps like Pages or Omni-Graffle.
You can drag and drop shapes and if you move it close to a magnetic point on another shape, it snaps to it.
